1. Code for correct operation with Android from version <b>5.1</b> to version <b>12</b><br>

    - ClientID <b>public static string clientId = "680415986169-250mk9kv1erqr1k94cb2i8bvu3lnfolr.apps.googleusercontent.com";</b><br><br>
    - SecretID <b>public static string clientSecret = "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";</b><br><br>
